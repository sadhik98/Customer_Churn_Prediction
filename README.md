# **Customer Churn Prediction with Streamlit Integration**

**Problem Statement:**

1.) The "Neural Networks for the Publishing Industry" project aims to predict customer churn behavior using historical order and client data.

2.) The project involves cleaning customer and order data, engineering relevant features, training a deep learning model, and deploying it via a Streamlit interface.

3.) This tool allows publishers to anticipate customer churn and take proactive business decisions to retain loyal clients.

----

**Features**

**Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Processed features like loyalty, inactive days, order count, and order date for modeling.

**Model Training & Evaluation:** Built and trained a deep learning model using neural networks for churn prediction.

**Model Serialization:** Saved the trained model using Joblib for seamless deployment.

**Streamlit Deployment:** Created an interactive web interface to predict customer churn in real time.

**Tools**

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Joblib, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

---

**Approach**

**Python:** Used as the primary language for scripting and model development.

**Pandas/NumPy:** For data preprocessing, transformation, and analysis.

**Scikit-learn:** For utility functions like splitting datasets and evaluation metrics.

**Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch):** Used for modeling customer churn prediction.

**Joblib:** For saving the trained model for reuse and deployment.

**Streamlit:** For building the frontend web interface to collect inputs and show predictions.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used to visualize patterns and churn distribution during EDA.

---

**Findings**

Findings → Customers with higher loyalty were less likely to churn; customers with fewer orders showed higher churn rates; churn distribution remained consistent across different years.
